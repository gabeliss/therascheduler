Client Booking Flow - Detailed Implementation & Testing Plan
Since the client booking widget is a core feature, we need to ensure:

It works seamlessly when embedded into a therapist’s website.
Clients only see available time slots.
Therapists can manage appointment requests efficiently.
It can be tested properly before rolling out.
🔹 Step 1: How the Client Booking Widget Will Work
Client Flow
Client visits a therapist’s website where the booking widget is embedded.
The widget loads available time slots (based on the therapist’s availability).
Client selects a date & time, enters their name, email, and optional phone number.
The system creates a pending appointment request in the therapist’s dashboard.
The therapist approves or denies the request via their appointments page.
The client receives an email/SMS confirmation if approved or a notification if denied.
If approved, the appointment appears in the therapist’s availability calendar & Google Calendar (if synced).
🔹 Step 2: Building the Client Booking Widget
Frontend Implementation
The widget will be a React component that can be embedded with a <script> tag.
It will call an API to fetch the therapist’s availability and display open slots.
When the client selects a slot, it will send a POST request to create a pending appointment.
The UI will confirm the request and display a success message.
Backend API Endpoints
GET /api/availability/:therapistId → Fetch therapist’s available time slots.
POST /api/appointments → Create a pending appointment request.
GET /api/appointments/:therapistId → Fetch all pending/confirmed appointments for display in therapist’s dashboard.
POST /api/appointments/:appointmentId/approve → Therapist approves appointment.
POST /api/appointments/:appointmentId/deny → Therapist denies appointment.
POST /api/appointments/:appointmentId/cancel → Therapist cancels an appointment.
🔹 Step 3: Embedding the Widget in a Therapist Website
For real-world use, therapists will copy a script snippet and paste it into their website.
Example:

html
Copy
Edit

<script src="https://yourapp.com/embed.js?therapistId=12345"></script>
<div id="booking-widget"></div>
The script will inject a React component into #booking-widget and handle client booking.
The widget will use URL parameters to identify the therapist (therapistId).
🔹 Step 4: How to Test It
1️⃣ Local Testing with a Fake Therapist Website
Create a basic static HTML page (test-therapist-site.html).
Embed the booking widget script and check if it loads properly.
Simulate client requests to verify API calls.
Inspect responses to confirm pending appointments appear in the therapist dashboard.
2️⃣ End-to-End Testing in a Staging Environment
Deploy the widget to a staging environment (e.g., Vercel).
Embed it into a real website (e.g., a free WordPress site or another test site).
Test client booking flow from start to finish:
Check real-time availability fetching.
Ensure appointments show up in the therapist’s dashboard.
Confirm email/SMS notifications send correctly.
Test approval & rejection flows.
🔹 Next Steps
1️⃣ Build the embeddable client booking widget (React + API calls).
2️⃣ Set up a fake therapist website (HTML page) to test embedding.
3️⃣ Implement backend API for appointment requests & approvals.
4️⃣ Deploy and test in a real environment.
