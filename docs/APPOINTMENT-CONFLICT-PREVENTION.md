# Appointment Conflict Prevention

TheraScheduler includes a robust conflict prevention system to ensure that therapists don't accidentally schedule appointments that conflict with their availability, time-off periods, or existing appointments.

## Types of Conflicts Detected

The system checks for three types of conflicts:

1. **Availability Conflicts**: Appointments that fall outside the therapist's regular working hours.
2. **Time-Off Conflicts**: Appointments that overlap with scheduled time-off periods.
3. **Appointment Conflicts**: Appointments that overlap with existing appointments.

## Conflict Severity Levels

Each conflict is assigned a severity level:

- **High**: Critical conflicts that should generally be avoided (e.g., complete overlap with time-off or another appointment)
- **Medium**: Significant conflicts that may require attention (e.g., appointment outside regular hours)
- **Low**: Minor conflicts that are generally informational

## How Conflict Detection Works

The conflict detection system works through the following process:

1. When a new appointment is being created, the system extracts the date, start time, and end time.
2. The system checks if the appointment falls within the therapist's regular availability hours.
3. The system checks if the appointment overlaps with any scheduled time-off periods.
4. The system checks if the appointment overlaps with any existing appointments.
5. If any conflicts are detected, the user is presented with a conflict resolution dialog.

### Appointment Conflict Detection

The system prevents double-booking by checking if a new appointment overlaps with any existing appointments:

1. The system retrieves all existing appointments for the therapist.
2. For each existing appointment, it checks if the new appointment's time range overlaps.
3. If an overlap is detected, a high-severity conflict is reported.
4. The conflict resolution dialog displays details about the conflicting appointment(s).

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts are detected, the system:

1. Displays a detailed conflict resolution dialog showing all detected conflicts.
2. Provides options to reschedule the appointment or override the conflict (if permitted).
3. For high-severity conflicts, requires explicit confirmation before allowing an override.
4. Tracks override reasons for audit and reporting purposes.

## Error Handling and Robustness

The conflict detection system includes several features to ensure robustness:

1. **Input Validation**: All date and time inputs are validated before processing.
2. **Flexible Time Format Handling**: The system can handle both ISO strings and time-only strings.
3. **Graceful Error Recovery**: If one conflict check fails, others will still be performed.
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging helps diagnose issues with conflict detection.
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative methods are used if primary methods fail.
6. **Date Validation**: Checks to ensure date objects are valid before using them.
7. **Safe Date Formatting**: Try-catch blocks around date formatting operations.
8. **Manual Formatting Fallbacks**: If automatic formatting fails, manual methods are used.
9. **Timezone Handling**: Proper handling of timezones to ensure accurate conflict detection.

## Best Practices

To minimize conflicts:

1. Regularly update your availability schedule.
2. Schedule time-off periods well in advance.
3. Review the appointment calendar before scheduling new appointments.
4. Use the conflict resolution dialog to make informed decisions about overrides.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the conflict prevention system include:

1. Conflict visualization on the calendar view.
2. Automated suggestions for alternative appointment times.
3. Recurring appointment conflict detection.
4. Client schedule conflict detection (for clients with multiple therapists).
